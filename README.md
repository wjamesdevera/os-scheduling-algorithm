# ICS26012 Alternative Assessment

This project demonstrates the implementation of two CPU scheduling algorithms and one disk scheduling algorithm.

## Algorithms Implemented

### CPU Scheduling Algorithms:
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**: A non-preemptive algorithm that selects the job with the smallest execution time.
- **Round Robin (RR)**: A preemptive algorithm that assigns a fixed time quantum to each process in a cyclic order.

### Disk Scheduling Algorithm:
- **SCAN**: A disk scheduling algorithm that moves the disk arm back and forth across the disk to service requests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html) or later installed on your machine.
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (or another Java IDE of your choice).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:wjamesdevera/os-scheduling-algorithm.git
    ```

2. **Open the project**:
    - Launch IntelliJ IDEA and open the cloned project directory.

3. **Ensure JDK 17 is set up**:
    - Make sure your project is configured to use JDK 17. You can do this by going to:
      ```
      File > Project Structure > Project > Project SDK > Select JDK 17
      ```
